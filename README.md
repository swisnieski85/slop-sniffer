# SlopSniffer

**SlopSniffer** is a Google Chrome extension that automatically detects and blocks AI-generated content ("slop") on LinkedIn posts. It identifies posts with telltale AI writing patterns and covers them with a friendly warning overlay, giving users control over what content they consume.

⚠️ SlopSniffer is constantly improving! **Check back often** for updates. ⚠️

## Status

**Beta Release**  
This is version `1.2` - a working Chrome extension ready for testing. The detection algorithm uses four distinct heuristics, with one more heuristic and several other improvements still planned. Because the extension is still in development, it is not a packed extension available through the Google chrome Web Store. It must be downloaded and then loaded as an unpacked extension (steps on doing this are included below).

## Features

- **Regex-Based Detection**: Quickly identifies posts containing classic signs of AI authorship (e.g., a contrast-framed sentence containing an em-dash: "it's not just stunning—it's brave")
- **Clean Interface**: Covers suspected AI posts with a gold-bordered overlay indicating the reason the content was identified as AI-generated
- **User Control**: "Show me the slop, anyway!" button to reveal content when desired
- **Feedback System**: Optional feedback buttons to help improve detection accuracy when
- **Performance Optimized**: Debounced processing that won't slow down LinkedIn

## Installation

### Prerequisites (Optional - for Git beginners)

If you don't have Git installed, you have two options:

**Option 1: Download ZIP (Easiest)**
1. Click the green "Code" button on this GitHub page
2. Select "Download ZIP"
3. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer
4. Skip to step 2 below

**Option 2: Install Git**
- **Windows**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- **Mac**: Install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with `brew install git`, or download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
- **Linux**: Use your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install git` on Ubuntu)

### For Users

1. Get the code:
   
   **If you installed Git:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swisnieski85/slop-sniffer.git
   ```
   
   **If you downloaded the ZIP:**
   Extract it to a folder like `slop-sniffer`

2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`

3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner)

4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `slop-sniffer` folder (don't double-click the folder; simply select it with a single-click and then click Select Folder)

5. The extension should now appear in your extensions list and work on LinkedIn.

### To update to the latest version

1. Follow the same steps above to re-clone or download the Git repo. If you are an approved beta-tester with a non-empty config.js file, make sure to copy this file elsewhere before re-cloning or downloading, and paste it back into the target directory after, to ensure it isn't overwritten.
2. In chrome://extensions, click the refresh button (a circular arrow) in the appropriate extension window.
3. Refresh your LinkedIn feed.

## Usage

1. **Browse LinkedIn normally** - SlopSniffer runs automatically in the background
2. **AI posts get flagged** - Suspected AI-generated posts will be covered with a gold-bordered overlay
3. **Choose to view or skip** - Click "Show me the slop, anyway!" to reveal the content
4. **Provide feedback** (optional) - Help improve detection by marking posts as correctly/incorrectly identified

## Feedback System

The extension includes an optional feedback system to help improve detection accuracy. Feedback is stored in a remote Firebase database, the project ID of which is stored in config.js.

### Beta Testing

If you'd like to help improve SlopSniffer by providing feedback on detection accuracy:

1. Ensure you have downloaded the latest version of SlopSniffer and loaded it into your Google Chrome extensions.
2. When you see a masked post in your LinkedIn feed, click "Show me the slop, anyway!" and then scroll the bottom to see feedback buttons for the post.
3. Click the appropriate button to submit feedback. If the post border changes and the buttons disappear, you know feedback has been submitted successfully.

Your feedback helps train the algorithm and reduces false positives for everyone!

## How Detection Works

Currently uses multiple heuristics that catch common AI writing patterns often seen in LinkedIn posts:

### 1. Contrast Framing (Inline)  
**Pattern:** Sentences containing dash-like characters where the clause before the dash includes negation words (e.g., "not", "isn't", "don't"), indicating contrast framing.  
**Examples flagged:**  
- "It's not just innovative — it's revolutionary"  
- "This isn't your average solution - it's transformative"  
- "We don't just deliver results — we exceed expectations"  

### 2. Contrast Framing (Sequential)
**Pattern**: Contrast framing across several successive sentences.
**Examples flagged:**  
- A sentence starting with **"Not because "** immediately followed by a sentence starting with **"Because "**.  ("Not because you're weak. Because you're strong.")
- A sentence starting with **"Sometimes "** that contains a negation word, followed by a sentence starting with **"It's"** (or "It’s").  ("Sometimes it's not about raising your voice. It's about being heard.")
- A sentence starting with **"This isn't"** immediately followed by a sentence starting with **"It's"**. ("This isn't about efficiency. It's about erosion.")

### 3. Negative Tricolon  
**Pattern:** Three consecutive sentences beginning with negation words or phrases such as "No", "Not", or the sequence "Not for", "Not for", then "For". Also triggers if two negation-starting sentences are followed by one starting with "Just".  
**Example flagged:**  
- "Not HR. Not your manager. Not the economy."
- "No skill. No talent. Just vibes."

### 4. Interrogative Hook  
**Pattern:** A short question (2-3 words) ending with a question mark, followed by a substantive sentence. This rhetorical style is common in AI-generated content trying to engage the reader.  
**Example flagged:**  
- "Her jaw? Dropped like she just saw Beyonce at the local gym."
- "And honestly? Sometimes we all need a break."

---

**Why this works:**  
AI writing models frequently rely on these stylistic devices to structure content and engage readers, often overusing them in ways that stand out compared to typical human writing patterns. This tool detects these signatures to flag likely AI-generated posts.


## Future Plans

- **More Detection Patterns**: One additional heuristic planned (based on emoji distributions)
- **Improved Accuracy**: Refinement of heuristics based on feedback
- **Better Targeting**: Prevent masking certain kinds of posts (e.g., job postings) which are of interest to users even if they are AI-generated
- **Other Browser/Device Implementations**: Maybe, eventually, expanding the extension to work for other browsers or even devices

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome! This project is actively maintained and interfaces may evolve as I add more detection methods.

**Current priorities**:
- Additional AI content detection patterns
- False positive reduction  
- Performance improvements
- User experience enhancements

## Privacy

SlopSniffer processes post content locally in your browser. No post content is transmitted externally unless you explicitly submit feedback (even then, the only data stored is your feedback, the timestamp, the LinkedIn post ID, and the SlopSniffer version number; no other data is stored regarding the user).
